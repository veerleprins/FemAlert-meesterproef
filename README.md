## Description

53% of all women in The Netherlands has experienced harassment in some way. <br>
Nowadays, unwanted and inappropriate behaviour towards victims keeps getting worse. Especially in clubs and festivals, people are more often the victim of harassment in any possible way. Sexual harassment and intimidation, aggression, racism and/or discrimination towards victims are mostly the main problems in todays nightlife.

That's where FemAlert comes in handy. FemAlert is an initiative, established by Rosanne Verbeek, to protect people (mostly women) from unwanted situations while partying or going out to clubs.
FemAlert is a platform where people can report any kind unacceptable behavior in an accessible way, without immediately taking it to the police. FemAlert also gives an option to get in touch with the victim to provide them help and support.

The platform FemAlert is also made for club owners to give them insights, to see exactly what's going on inside of their clubs. With these insights, club owners can anticipate on the situations to make the nightlife much more safer and better in their venues.

Our job is to make a neat-designed and detailled dashboard for club owners to provide them with visualized data about the reports made in/for their clubs.

## Features

To create the dashboard, we first had to make some designs. To do this, we used a program called Figma. In Figma, it's possible to create and design multiple pages, to make different versions of our dashboard. Figma is basically a sandbox to mess around an try out different kinds of designs/layouts.

The main focus of our project is to create a desktop version for our dashboard, but we're also creating a mobile version. This way it makes it possible for bouncers to get notified on new reports, so that they can anticipate on them and help the victims when needed.

The desktop version of the dashboard is devided in 4 parts:

- Home
- Map
- All reports
- Settings

### Home

On this page, multiple unique graphs and charts are being shown with data about the reports made on a particulary date/period. Here's a screenshot of our design for the main page:
--- Insert screenshot ---

The main function on this page is the chart that shows the amount of reports made in a week. On this chart, you can filter the weeks, and the different types of harassments reported in that week. For example, if you want to see what reports were made last week, you can just click on the button of that particular week, and it shows the amounts of reports made in that week, on each day. To see what kinds of harassments these reports were, you have to click on them, and it filters out the rest of the reports.

Also being shown on this page is a donut chart with the different harassment types, on a particular date or period. Next to this chart is a section with a counter of the total amount of reports made on that day.

These visualizations provide the most important data for club owners, and gives them the information needed with just a glance.

### Map

On this page, a heatmap is shown. In our case we are using a heatmap of Amsterdam, because it's one of most famous nightlife-cities of The Netherlands.
