## 📝 Description

53% of all women in The Netherlands have experienced harassment in some way. <br>
Nowadays, unwanted and inappropriate behaviour towards victims keeps getting worse. Especially in clubs and festivals, people are more often the victim of harassment in any possible way. Sexual harassment and intimidation, aggression, racism and/or discrimination towards victims are the main problems in todays nightlife.

That's where FemAlert comes in handy. FemAlert is an initiative, established by Rosanne Verbeek, to protect people (mostly women) from unwanted situations while partying or going out to clubs.
FemAlert is a platform where people can report any kind of unacceptable behavior in an accessible way, without immediately taking it to the police. FemAlert also lets club or bar owners get in touch with victims to help them and offer support.

The platform FemAlert is also made for club owners to give them insights, to see exactly what's going on inside of their clubs. With these insights, club owners can anticipate on the situations to make the nightlife much safer and better in their venues.

Our job is to make a neat-designed and detailled dashboard for club owners to provide them with visualized data about the reports made in/for their clubs.

## 🔢 Data

FemAlert is still a concept, which means it doesn't have a working application yet. Because it's still a work in progress, we couldn't be provided with real data. Therefore we had to generate our own dummy data. To do this, we used the online tool mockaroo.com. With Mockaroo you can create mock data, to your own likings. Based on the steps you have to take and the forms you have to fill in while making a new report, we created the dummy data with corresponding data-types and values.

## 📊 Features

To create the dashboard, we first had to make some designs. To do this, we used Figma. In Figma, it's possible to create and design multiple pages, to make different versions of our dashboard. Figma is basically a sandbox to mess around in and try out different kinds of designs/layouts.

Our job is to create a mobile and desktop version of a dashboard which will give insights into the reports which have been made at a club, bar of festival. Our main focus is to create a mobile version. This way it makes it possible for bouncers to get notified on new reports, so that they can anticipate on them and help the victims when needed.

In the next chapters, the features of the dashboard will be explained for both versions.

## 💻 Desktop version

The desktop version of the dashboard is devided in 4 parts:

- Home
- Map
- All Reports
- Settings

### 🏠 Home

On this page, multiple unique graphs and charts are being shown with data about the reports made on a particulary date/period.<br>
Here's a screenshot of our design for the 'Home' page:<br><br>

The main focus of this page is the bar chart which shows the amount of reports which have been made. On this chart, you can filter the weeks, and the different types of harassments reported in that week. For example, if you want to see what reports were made last week, you can just click on the button of that particular week, and it shows the amounts of reports made in that week, on each day. To see what types of harassments these reports were, you have to click on them, and it filters out the rest of the reports.

Also being shown on this page is a donut chart with the different harassment types, on a particular date or period. Next to this chart is a section with a counter of the total amount of reports made on that day.

These visualizations provide the most important data for club owners, and give them the information needed with just a glance.

### 📌 Map

On this page, a heatmap is shown. In our case we are using a heatmap of Amsterdam, because it's one of most famous and busiest nightlife-cities of The Netherlands.
<br>
Here's a screenshot of our design for the 'Map' page: <br><br>
<img src="https://imgur.com/a3q1mE1.png" width="500" height="300">

We are using a heatmap to give an indication to the club owners to see where te most reports are made. The different club owners can then compare their clubs to others.<br>
Because of privacy reasons, we decided to use a heatmap instead of a regular map that pinpoints the specific locations of the reports. With this heatmap, the club owners can see the areas in stead of the exact locations of the reports. The darker the color on the map, the more reports have been made in that specific area.

### 📑 All Reports

On this page, all the reports are being shown in detail. Here you can see the story of the victim, the type of harassment they reported, the date and time, if the victim needs help, and if the victim wants to be contacted by FemAlert. If you click on one of the reports, you will see the victims name and email address, given that they gave permission for the club owner to reach out.<br>
Here's a screenshot of our design for the 'All Reports' page: <br><br>
<img src="https://imgur.com/hahEljQ.png" width="500" height="300">

As you can see on the screenshot of our design, we have implemented a searchbar to find specific reports. With the search bar, you can find reports for specific days and times as well as a specific type of harassment.

Next to the section with all the reports, you can see two pie charts. These charts visualize the amount of victims who asked for help or want to be in contact with FemAlert.

### 🔩 Settings

On this page, the settings of the club owner are shown. The club owners can edit their information here, or turn on the Dark theme mode. Here's a screenshot of our design for the 'Settings' page:<br><br>
<img src="https://imgur.com/RzhchBy.png" width="500" height="300">

As you can see, the information of the club and it's owner is being shown on this page. The club owner can also edit it's information, log out, or turn on the Dark theme mode.

The Dark theme mode is an extra feature we are implementing if we have enough time to do so. Our main focus will be at the other pages, where the functionalities of the dashboard are the most important.
